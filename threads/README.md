## Description

This program uses the [**thread**] module from the standard library.

In the [**thread**] module, there is a public function named [**spawn**] which takes a closure and creates an OS thread executing that closure.
Upon creating the thread, [**spawn**] immediately returns to the caller, so the parent thread is not blocked.
[**spawn**] returns a generic struct [**JoinHandle<**T**>**], which is used to wait for the created thread to finish.

Upon creating the new thread, the main thread writes **Hello from the main thread!** to the standard output.
The main thread then starts waiting for the new thread to finish using the [**join**] method on the [**JoinHandle<**T**>**] returned from the [**spawn**] call at the beginning of the program.
Meanwhile, the new thread is executing the closure that we passed while calling the [**spawn**] function.

This closure is marked with **move** because otherwise **data_to_pass** would have been captured by reference.
This is a huge problem since, theoretically, the new thread may outlive the creator thread, which could make captured reference invalid.

Anyway, the closure that we passed while calling the [**spawn**] function writes **Hello from the new thread!** to the standard output then returns **data_to_pass + 42**.

Now the main thread can continue its execution.
The [**join**] function returns the result of the closure to the main thread, which is **data_to_pass + 42** in this case.

Then, we assert that the **threads_return** is indeed **data_to_pass + 42** and we are done.

## Usage

```
$ cargo run -q --package threads
```

## Arguments and flags

None

## Example runs

```
$ cargo run -q --package threads
Hello from the main thread!
Hello from the new thread!
```

```
$ cargo run -q --package threads
Hello from the new thread!
Hello from the main thread!
```

## Known bugs

None

## Limitations

None

## Notes

- The [**spawn**] function panics if the OS fails to create the thread.
  If explicit control over the possible errors is required, [**std::thread::Builder**] can be used.

- Usage of the [**unwrap**] method on [**join**]'s result was on purpose.
  This is because [**join**] will only result in [**Err**] if the new thread panics and, while it is possible for the new thread to panic due to [**println!**], it is highly unlikely that the panic will occur.
